Reporting Issues:
---------
We have had problems with bug reports that lack sufficient information.


The problem is that people aren't giving us enough information to 
replicate bugs. If we cannot identify exactly under what conditions 
a bug is present, then it becomes harder to fix. 

Please, if you report a bug, provide ample information about your situation. 


If you need an answer in a timely manner, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tMVPVJf): 

We really appreciate when you report bugs, and we would like you to report them to us whenever you find them.
However please be mindful of the information that you give us and/or how you contact us. If you really have no 
idea where to start, maybe a 1 on 1 conversation on Discord may be the way to go. If you know exactly how to replicate your problem, or 
you have a good amount of information about it, creating a new issue might be a better solution:
