## Options
# %k : the killer (can be a player, mob, or environment)
# %d : the dead player
# %i : item used to kill the player (if one exists)
# %n : number (used for streaks, rampages)

## Messages
# If a BattleTracker message is defaulting to 'unknown', that most
# likely means it has not been added yet. Upon an unknown death, a
# message is sent to the console with the unformatted death reason (or entity).
# If you want to add it yourself, take a look at this page:
